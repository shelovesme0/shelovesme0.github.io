    <p>The Porsche 982 is the internal designation of the fourth generation Boxster/Cayman (third generation Cayman) made by German automobile manufacturer Porsche. With the switch to a new turbocharged flat-four engine the marketing name for the models was changed to Porsche 718, in reference to the 718, which won the Targa Florio race in 1959 and 1960. The name is meant to evoke Porsche's past racing successes with light cars like the 718 that outmaneuvered competitors with larger and more powerful engines.</p>
